You’re going through a breakup. Life isn’t going according to whatever you expected. When doctors see you feeling unwell, they write out a solution for your problems which you are to take regularly until it is resolved or to keep it resolved. When you see life going unwell, you should do the same. Setting goals and then taking them on in small dosages is exactly what it takes to resolve the problem of life causing you to feel unwell.

      "text" : "Lorem Ipsum. \nThe Difference Between a Coder and a Developer\n\nThe answer has been clear all along. It’s been right in front of us sitting there as un-decoded filler text.\n\nThe standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s:\n\n\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"\n\n1914 translation by H. Rackham:\n\n\"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\n\nIt is evident that the answer rests in this text. One who takes on the task of working harder to understand and perfect their craft in order to have more pleasure from working within it, is a developer. \n\nOne who thinks of learning as unnecessarily strenuous and avoids difficult tasks only to receive no pleasure from working within the field as a result, is a coder.",

I knew he could sense my intense focus and it was obvious he had oppositions to it. He was endlessly crying and fussing the whole 90 minutes. I ended up getting a 95 and I don’t know how, but the moment I put the laptop down, he went back to ignoring me. Children have a way of helping you tap into your inner strengths, ability to overcome obstacles, and resourcefulness. Parenting grows you as an individual and forces you to meet the same levels as other people without kids in order to be hirable. Also there’s that moment when you accomplish something that not many people without kids can do, and it’s amazing. Here are some tips I’ve learned to help you navigate early childhood parenting and becoming an emerging force in the IT field.",

      "text" : "It's Completely Unproductive Yet Completely Necessary These Days to Have a Plan B\nWhy a Fallback Plan Denotes a Failure Mentality\n\nI watch a LOT of Anime. One thing I’ve learned -- none of the main characters have a backup plan. They’re prepared to die by the sword (or whatever weapon they’re wielding at the moment). They put their all into whatever is in front of them and nothing, not even the threat of poverty will stop them from succeeding and surviving to be drawn in the next episode. Exactly, it’s a cartoon.  We’re not. There are real repercussions for that kind of behavior and while it would be great to put my entire being in everything I do, I simply cannot. Life is too complex to not prepare for failure. However, in the very event that you’re preparing for failure, you’re taking energy away from your success preparations which is unproductive, yet completely necessary. I’m going to cover how to find a balance in providing a fallback plan without sacrificing too much towards your success.",

      "text" : "Almost a Waste of Time\nSugar-coded Lessons in Programming in PHP\n\nThere are a plethora of free coding resources out there, and if you’re in a financial bind, they are a godsend. If you’re not however and you can afford $25-30 per month for a few months, just invest in your education. Here’s my account from 2015 on why: \n\nOkay, there is much mastery to learn in what feels like a little time on this Earth. I put in for an awesome opportunity-- this coding 'bootcamp' located in Norcross. If it goes well, I'm going to be having the time of my techy little life over 12 weeks. However there's work to do...\n\nPHP\/MySQL.\n\nI knew nothing about it really, aside from it being a language of the databases. I remember about a month ago, I didn't really know where my time was going to be spent this summer or where to start with programming. I'm not a total novice. I can apply the logic of object-oriented programming from a few Computer Science classes I picked up at my university last year.\n\nDespite my adoration for Java and UML diagrams, I'm not a CS major. I opted for a degree in Information Science & Technology because I liked the well-rounded approach of SDLC theoretics being applied to the curriculum. As time progresses with the major, it's also set up for you to learn all about database management, so I preserved my excitement for that day-- BUT, life has a way of changing things around and putting things in front of you in due time.\n\nSo far I've taken the Codecademy Introduction to PHP course. To my surprise, it's a hell of a lot like Java. Actually, it's so much like Java, I breezed through it with minimal issues compared to Java which nearly made me cry. I knew PHP couldn't be that easy though. And it didn't take long to see they left out all the hard parts and virtually everything to do with an underscore (isn't that like all of it?). So upon completing the sugar-coated course, I received a 100%, however I felt like I still had learned zip percent about PHP. My thirst for knowledge continued.\n￼\nWhat I've Learned\nAs the time got further and further away, I realized this course was not getting any harder. Finally I had completed it just to see 100%. The course pathetically lacked depth to the point that I didn't even gather a false sense of security from it. The lesson it taught me was far from the one that it intended to: Skip ahead next time. Look the course over, and decide to yourself, \"Is this really worth the next x amount of hours?\"\n\nIn conclusion, I leave a brief note for the Codecademies out there.\nI understand we're handing out awards to people who just participate nowadays, and the need for praise and self-worth is ever-present as well. But let's not waste people's time with this kind of redundant and minimal effort teaching. If this were an object-oriented programming refresher, then this would be great, however it's not. And that's the problem.\n\n<\/ End of 2015 flashback>\n\nSo when I started paying for subscriptions and finding subscriptions that were apart of my tuition like Lynda.com, life became much more enjoyable. Not only were the lessons much clearer, but they give great overviews. You spend less time listening and watching, while spending more time learning. You’ll have a better understanding of concepts.",

In school, I talked to the goth kids, the jocks, the nerds, the popular kids (when I had to), and everyone in between. It made me a knockout in sales as I progressed to the ranks of a territory account manager, interacting with over thirty retailers while working for T-Mobile. I was the youngest person with the job of all the other account managers and I was boosting sales in rural areas by as much as 433%. I could relate to just about anyone because I always made it a goal to find a common ground between me and the next person I interacted with, even if it was about something completely simple. Everyone has something in common, even in IT where you can come across some quite uninteresting people. I look at them like radios. You just have to dial into the right station to get their reception. I’m going to go over proven methods when it comes to bridging the gap in IT.",

We’ve got some things to go over first. \n\nThink of your kid as the product you’re trying to build and deploy out of the house eventually, and the process of teaching them to code should follow an SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle).

Initially, I thought it was a waste of my time to explain why you can’t just pick up a keyboard and become a web\/mobile application developer in a few months, but I’m aware of my version of realism sounding a lot like negativity. To be honest, it was negativity. I first asked myself why did I not want to give valid help and realized it was because often people don’t understand the complexities we face as software engineers or why we’re paid like we are. I’m often faced with people discounting my efforts and treating me like all I do is color on a screen. He didn’t say any of that. He just said he wanted to learn. I was just jumping the gun unnecessarily. So I reeled myself back, and picked up another mentee. And this is what he needed to know.",

Often times, I’ve been avoided in conversation, in favor of having the same conversations with subordinates about Argyle socks with the guys every week. It felt so strange. It was times like that I felt like I didn’t belong in IT.  It was this same insecurity that actually pushed me harder to be ‘unignorable’ on paper. I could be wrong, but I feel like when you’re a minority, whether by gender, race, background, or anything else, you have to push that much harder to be considered and accepted. And as a non-minority, it’s plausible to feel like affirmative action, people coming into the work force on visas, and things of the like are causing good jobs to slip out of your hands. So there is a valid insecurity on both sides. How can you harness that? I’m going to go over establishing a strong presence that will get a hiring manager’s attention.",

I never understood the congratulations. I’ve come to understand they’re not really congratulating me on being a Software Engineer. They’re congratulating me on breaking the income-gap mold determined by my demographics. I am in the global 1% as far as income earned. By myself, in America my income places me in the top 25% of households, top 10% among Black households, and top 5% amongst women. I’ve also lived in public housing, received food stamps, and been on welfare. Most of the people I come across in IT, haven’t really experienced living below the federal poverty level. A lot thought they were poor despite coming from 6-figure households. It’s mind-boggling the odds of a poor person breaking into a higher tax bracket (I believe 5%). What’s even more mind-boggling is the experience. I’m going to take a moment to discuss the challenges I faced going from extreme poverty to being well-off, as well as being a woman in IT, a mother in IT, and last but not least, being Black in IT.",
